 * Given a positive integer n, return the smallest next higher integer with the same number of 1s as n in binary representation.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * 1 â‰¤ n < 2 ** 30
 * Example 1
 * Input
 * n = 3
 * Output
 * 5
 * Explanation
 * 3 in binary is 0011 and next higher from 3 with two ones would be 5 which is 0101 in binary.
