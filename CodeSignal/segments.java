/*
You are given a set of closed line segments, represented as a two-dimensional integer array segments. Each segment segments[i] is of the form [l, r], where l is the coordinate of its left endpoint and r is the coordinate of its right endpoint.

Let's say that the segment [l, r] contains the point x if the point is located inside the segment, i.e. l ≤ x ≤ r. Your task is to find the minimal number of points that can be placed somewhere on the number line, so that each segment contains at least one point.
